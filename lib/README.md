Here are six “tough-boilerplate” C libraries that are both ubiquitous and prime candidates for a Cicili-style macro DSL. Each involves layers of repetitive setup/teardown, verbose struct definitions or callback wiring—exactly what Cicili excels at hiding.

1) POSIX Threads (pthreads)  
   • Why it’s painful: you write the same pthreadattrt, pthreadmutext, pthreadcondt boilerplate over and over, plus error checks on every call.  
   • Cicili could give you  
     `lisp
     (ThreadPool :size 8
       (Task foo (arg int)  
         (body  
           …))  
       (Task bar (arg void*)  
         (body  
           …)))
     `  
     and expand into pthreadcreate loops, pthreadjoin, attr/destroy calls, and a clean C API for submitting tasks or shutting down.

2) Berkeley Sockets (TCP/UDP)  
   • Why it’s painful: socket(), bind(), listen(), accept(), setsockopt, select()/poll(), read/write loops, shutdown/close… error paths everywhere.  
   • Cicili could give you  
     `lisp
     (NetServer
       :port 8080
       :proto tcp
       (on-connect (client-sock)  
         (for-each-request client-sock  
           (dispatch (request)  
             (case GET (handle-get request))  
             (case POST (handle-post request))))))
     `  
     then spit out all the socket(), bind(), listen() setup plus a select() or poll() loop with nonblocking I/O and per-connection callbacks.

3) JSON Serialization / Parsing (e.g. jsmn or cJSON)  
   • Why it’s painful: you craft cJSONCreateObject(), call cJSONAddNumberToObject(), then cJSON_Print(), and inverse for parsing—lots of pointer juggling and type-checks.  
   • Cicili could give you  
     `lisp
     (JSONStruct Person
       ((name string)
        (age  int)
        (tags [string]))
     `  
     and generate struct Person { … };, PersontoJSON(), PersonfromJSON(), with deep traversal, null-checks, array loops, and freeing functions.

4) SQLite Access Layer  
   • Why it’s painful: sqlite3open(), sqlite3prepare_v2(), bind parameters by index, step rows, extract columns, finalize, close… repeated per query.  
   • Cicili could give you  
     `lisp
     (SQLiteDB "employees.db"
       (Table Employee (id   int primary key autoinc)
                        (name text)
                        (salary real))
       (Query getEmployeeById (id int) :returns Employee)
       (Query insertEmployee (name text) (salary real)))
     `  
     which expands into struct Employee, dbgetEmployeeById(), dbinsertEmployee(), full prepare/bind/step/finalize code.

5) HTTP Client (libcurl)  
   • Why it’s painful: curleasyinit(), curleasysetopt(), callbacks for write/data, error-check codes, curleasycleanup().  
   • Cicili could give you  
     `lisp
     (HTTPClient default
       (GET  "https://api.example.com/users"  (on-data (buf len) …))
       (POST "https://api.example.com/login"  :json creds  (on-data …)))
     `  
     generating all the curleasysetopt calls, header setup, request body injection, response callbacks.

6) OpenSSL Crypto Primitives  
   • Why it’s painful: loading engines, EVPCIPHERCTX, EVPEncryptInitex(), EVPEncryptUpdate(), EVPEncryptFinalex(), error handling via ERRget_error().  
   • Cicili could give you  
     `lisp
     (Cipher AES256-CBC
       (Encrypt  key iv plaintext  (out ciphertext))
       (Decrypt  key iv ciphertext (out plaintext)))
     `  
     that wires up EVP contexts, key/iv setting, buffer management, padding, and cleanup.

—  
In each case, Cicili’s layers of  
1) Scope (include-guards, headers),  
2) Header DSL (typedefs, structs, func decls),  
3) Source DSL (func bodies, error checks),  
4) Convenience macros (higher-level DSL form)  

can turn dozens of lines of boilerplate into a few declarative forms—boosting safety, consistency, and developer productivity.
